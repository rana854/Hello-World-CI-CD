# Jenkins pipeline
The Jenkins pipeline for our Python project is designed to automate essential development processes, including building, testing, and validation. By integrating Jenkins, a powerful CI/CD tool, into our workflow, we aim to streamline the deployment of code changes, ensuring efficiency and reliability throughout the development lifecycle.

## Tools Needed
- Jenkins
- Docker
- Python
- git
- GitHub account
- Git installed on the Jenkins server

Steps to Use Jenkins Pipeline for Python Project:
Set Up Jenkins:
Install necessary plugins: Ensure that Jenkins has plugins for Git integration and Pipeline.
Configure Jenkins credentials: Add credentials for accessing your GitHub repository if it's private.
Create Jenkins Pipeline:
Go to Jenkins dashboard and select "New Item".
Enter a name for your pipeline job and choose "Pipeline" as the job type.
In the pipeline configuration, select "Pipeline script from SCM".
Choose Git as the SCM and provide the repository URL.
Specify the branch to build (e.g., */develop).
Write Jenkinsfile:
Create a Jenkinsfile in the root directory of your Python project.
Define the stages of your pipeline in the Jenkinsfile, including checkout, build, test, etc.
Use the appropriate syntax (e.g., Groovy DSL for declarative pipeline or Scripted pipeline).
Configure Jenkins Pipeline:
In the Jenkins pipeline configuration, specify the path to your Jenkinsfile (e.g., Jenkinsfile).
Optionally, configure additional settings such as triggers, post-build actions, etc.
Run Pipeline:
Save your pipeline configuration and trigger a build manually to test the pipeline.
Jenkins will automatically fetch the code from your GitHub repository, execute the pipeline stages defined in the Jenkinsfile, and display the build status and output.
Monitor Pipeline Execution:
Monitor the progress of your pipeline on the Jenkins dashboard.
View the console output to troubleshoot any issues encountered during the build and test stages.
Customize Pipeline:
Customize your Jenkinsfile and pipeline configuration according to your project requirements.
Add additional stages, steps, or integrations as needed to enhance automation and functionality.

## Jenkinsfile
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/rana854/cicd-project-1.git'![Uploading ci_cd.jpgâ€¦]()

            }
        }
        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                bat 'pip install -r "Django project/myproject/requirements.txt"'
            }
        }
        stage('Run Tests') {
            steps {
                bat 'python "Django project/myproject/manage.py" test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying the application'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
